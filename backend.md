# 🧠Backend to My Kite Game?

## 🧩 It Depends on Your Use Case

---

## ✅ Add Backend If:

| Purpose | Why Add Backend? |
|--------|------------------|
| Global Leaderboard | Store and sync scores of all players online |
| Multiplayer Gameplay | For real-time play between remote players |
| Player Accounts | Login, profile, and progress tracking |
| Live Match Data | Matchmaking, score syncing, or real-time updates |

### 🔧 Tools You Can Use:
- **Node.js + Express** – for custom APIs
- **Firebase Firestore / Realtime DB** – easy, no server setup
- **Flask (Python)** – lightweight, good for REST APIs (and you already know it 😉)

---

## ❌ You Can Skip Backend If:

| Situation | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| College Submission Only | Most frontend-only projects are acceptable |
| Offline or Single-Player Focus | Local storage is sufficient |
| No Login or Global Sync Needed | Browser’s localStorage works great |

---

## ⚙️ Pro Tip: Make Your Code Backend-Ready

Instead of directly saving score:

```js
saveToLeaderboard(name, score);
```

Use abstraction so later you can switch easily:

```js
// Later connect to backend here
postScoreToServer(name, score);
```
